# Data Visualization Challenge: Pymaceuticals

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to use Matplotlib to generate tables of data and convert them into various visuals. In particular, the requirement is to analyze data of 10 drugs that were tested against 249 mice that were identified with tumors. The goal is to figure out which drug is the most effective to heal the tumor, and more importantly, cure SCC cancer.

The following tasks were required for the project:
- Data preparation
- Summary statistics
- Creation of Bar and Pie Charts
- Creation of Quartiles, Find Outliers, and create a Box Plot
- Creation of Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
- Calculation of Correlation and Regression
